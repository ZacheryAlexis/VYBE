# Vybe — Campus Fragrances

This repository contains a simple PHP-based inventory/demo site repurposed for "Vybe" — a fictional cologne/perfume brand aimed at college students.

What I changed:
- Updated site branding and copy to "Vybe" (header, footer, homepage title).
- Updated styles in `inventory/ih_styles.css` to a youthful color palette.
- Replaced example product data in `database_scripts/` SQL files with perfume-related sample items and categories.

Quick start (local PHP server):

```bash
# from project root
php -S localhost:8000 -t inventory
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

Notes:
- This project is a content/theme update only; database credentials and environment setup are not included.
- Product images should be added to `inventory/images/` (use non-copyrighted placeholders).

If you'd like, I can:
- add placeholder product images,
- generate sample SQL import commands for MySQL,
- or change copy further to match a marketing tone.
